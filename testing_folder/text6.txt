In our company policy, it is clearly stated that sensitive terms like aadhaar, pan, or credit card should never be stored directly in the system. If a document contains words such as card number or cvv, it should immediately be flagged. Any mention of passport or passport no must also be handled securely. Information like bank account or account number should remain encrypted, and ifsc codes should always be validated. Financial documents such as salary slips or payroll reports require high-priority classification. For international projects, terms like ssn or social security might appear, which makes monitoring critical. Finally, if a file includes secret or confidential, it should be reported instantly to the compliance team.
